The STEP export is from my WIP (work in progress) version of the file, so it is incomplete, messy and not finished in any way.

As of today, 2020MAR08, the z stage is fairly done, pending iteration, the halo needs lots of work
- The belts need to flip as they attach to the print head at the wrong place
- There are several copies of the y stage axis, this is showing the range of movement I was protecting for
- The print head is unchanged from the RailCore
- Further studies of the halo with rails on halo are not in main assembly, will upload as separate subassembly
